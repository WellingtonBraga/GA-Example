# Genetic Algorith Example

This is the first example of how powerful a Genetic Algorith can be.

## Purpose

This algorith was created to solve the question below, and can be used as an initial point of GA study.

Consider a problem where ten non-repeated cards (from 1 to 10) are grouped into two sets A and B. 
The objective function of set A is to get a sum of the values of the cards as close as possible to 36. 
The purpose of set B is Obtain the result of multiplying the values of the cards as close to 360 as possible.

Write a GA that solves this issue.

### The Fittest

The Fittest element is one which has the fitness more closer than 0 as possible.
